# Solving-Compressible-NSE
Solving compressible Navier Stokes Equations over a flat plate using McCormick differential method


Code written as part of the midterm project for MAE 290C: Computational Fluid Dynamics. The Mccormick method was implemented to solve an unsteady, compressible flow over a flat plate
